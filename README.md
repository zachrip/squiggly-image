# Squiggly Image

I recently came across this post on reddit: "[Experimenting with new methods to make single line portraits and wanted to share today's drawing](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/slh2zg/experimenting_with_new_methods_to_make_single/)" and I thought to myself how I might recreate it for any image.
